# My Neural Networks from Scratch in Python

## About This Repository

This repository contains my implementation of the code and algorithms from the book Neural Networks from Scratch in Python by Harrison Kinsley & Daniel Kukiela.  If you are interested in the topic go to the official website [nnfs.io](https://nnfs.io) and learn more there.  I will modify the source as I work through the book to fit my particular needs and style.  This repository is not going to be a good place for you as I'm not going to explain everything I do or why I made the changes that I did.
